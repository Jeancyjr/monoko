# Monoko - Language Learning Platform for African Languages

**Speak the Heart of Africa**

## Mission

Monoko is an African language-learning platform designed to make learning languages like Swahili, Lingala, and Amharic enjoyable, immersive, and deeply effective. Our mission is to eliminate language barriers across Africa by creating a beautiful, intuitive app that blends technology, culture, and communication—so learners don't just memorize words but truly live the language.

## Why Monoko?

As more people relocate to or return to Africa—whether for work, family, retirement, or business—a common challenge emerges: the language barrier. Imagine being part of a conversation that suddenly switches to a local language you don't understand. You feel left out, disconnected, unable to express yourself or relate to the culture around you.

**Monoko is here to change that.**

We believe that language is belonging. And Monoko exists to help you speak, connect, and belong.

## What Makes Monoko Unique

### Learn African Languages Only

We focus exclusively on African languages — starting with:
- **Swahili** 🇰🇪🇹🇿
- **Lingala** 🇨🇩🇨🇬  
- **Amharic** 🇪🇹

Each language is taught through real-life context, native speaker audio, culture-based lessons, and practical phrases that empower learners to speak and think locally.

## Core Features

### 1. Structured, Immersive Learning
- Daily bite-sized lessons (5–10 minutes)
- Speak-first methodology

- Cultural tips integrated into lessons

### 2. Fun Practice Games
